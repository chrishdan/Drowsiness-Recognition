# Drowsiness-Recognition

School project in collaboration with Olav Adamsr√∏d

This project is a drowsiness recognition software which could be used to alert drivers when they are tired/drowsy. 

When mouth is wide open and/or eyes are closed (for a set time amount), the user is alerted by sound (and text on camera screen).

We utilized this facial landmark to find and track the mouth and eye features

How it looks when drowsiness is not detected. MAR = mouth aspect ratio, EAR = eye aspect ratio.
